  journal = {Journal of Applied Econometrics},
  year = {2006},
  volume = {21},
  pages = {861-878},
  number = {6},
  abstract = { The popularity of stated choice (SC) experiments has produced many
	design strategies in which researchers use increasingly more 'complex'
	choice settings to study choice behaviour. When the amount of information
	to assess increases, we wonder how an individual handles such information
	in making a choice. Defining the amount of information as the number
	of attributes associated with each choice set, we investigate how
	this information is processed as we vary its 'complexity'. Four ordered
	heterogeneous logit models are developed, each for an SC design based
	on a fixed number of attributes, in which the dependent variable
	defines the number of attributes that are ignored. We find that the
	degree to which individuals ignore attributes is influenced by the
	dimensionality of the SC experiment, the deviation of attribute levels
	from an experienced reference alternative, the use of 'adding up'
	attributes where feasible, the number of choice sets evaluated, and
	the personal income of the respondent. The empirical evidence supports
	the view that individuals appear to adopt a range of 'coping' strategies
	that are consistent with how they process information in real markets,
	and that aligning 'choice complexity' with the amount of information
	to process is potentially misleading. Relevancy is what matters.
